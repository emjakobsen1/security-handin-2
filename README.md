# DSYS4
Security hand-in 2
(old readme from previous below)
##  How to run

 1. Run `main.go` in 3 separate terminals

    ```
    $ go run main.go 0
    $ go run main.go 1
    $ go run main.go 2
    ```

It is hardcoded for 3 peers with port 5000, 5001 and 5002. 


2. A peer will create a log.txt in the root directory under the name `logs/peer(*)-log.txt`, with `*` being the bound port. Peers log their actions and logical timestamps. The critical section is present seperate log in `logs/cs-log.txt`. The logs are automatically cleared each time the program starts.
